Introduction
============

Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescent microscopy (t-CyCIF) is a simple method
for generating highly multiplexed optical images from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples routinely used for histopathological
diagnosis of human disease. The method is described in Lin et al. (2018),
[*Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors
using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes*
](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31657).

Here we have reproduced several plots from the Figure 5 & 6 in the manuscript as an
interactive Jupyter notebook. Here, we provides 3 plots (Figure 6A: Density scatter 
plot; Figure 6A: Histogram of 4 cycles; Figure 6D: Histogram to compared 2 cycle)
Whereas the manuscript only has space for plots of a few antibody combinations from 
a few samples, this notebook allows replotting of any combination available in the 
full dataset (including one sets of Tonsil samples and two sets of Melanoma samples).

Instructions
============

To view the data interactively:

1. First, install Jupyter. If you are new to Python, we recommend installing
   Anaconda Python (which contains Jupyter). You must get the Python 3.6
   version of Anaconda, not the 2.7 version!

   https://www.anaconda.com/download/

1. Open Jupyter either by clicking on its icon, or by typing `jupyter notebook`
   in a terminal. This will open up Jupyter in your web browser.

1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .ipynb file and the data
   files.

1. Click on `figure_6.ipynb` to open the notebook. From there, click
   "Cell" and then "Run All" from the menu.

Please refer to `Antibody_list_SampleA.csv` & `Antibody_list_SampleB.csv` for
detailed information about the antibodies used.
